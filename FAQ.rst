#. **What is a static download and why do we use it?**

    There are times when you want to do a call of your information on-line, 
    but this call can take more that 5 minutes, so, how can we do this quicker?
    We will download all of your information necessary to our servers,
    so when this happens, we can send you the static information
    that we have loaded in our system.



#. **In the tag "RequiredAllPassenger", is specifying the names of the babies necessary?**

    If the value of "RequiredAllPassengers" is true in the static data, then yes,
    it is necessary
