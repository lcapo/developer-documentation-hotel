#. **What is a static download and why do we use it?**

    There are times when you want to do a call of your information online, 
    but this call can take more that 5 minutes, so, how can we do this quicker?
    We will download all of your information necessary to our server,
    so when this happens, and we can send you the static information
    that we have loaded in our system.
