#. **How many providers can we do a one request?**

	Only one provider per request. The only exception is with the petition MultiAvail, where you can use one or more providers. 

#. **How can I identify which providers is which in the MultiAvail call?**

	By using the field ID in the request. 
	
	For example:
	
	
	**In the request:**
	
	::

	<!--First provider-->               <!--Second provider-->
	<ns:code>TEST</ns:code>             <ns:code>TEST2</ns:code>
	<ns:id>1</ns:id>                    <ns:id>2</ns:id>
	
	**In the response:**
	
	::
	
	<!--Response first provider-->       <!--Response Second provider-->
	<refId>1</refId>                     <refId>2</refId>
	

#. **How does the price work and how should I interpret the value in the field "commission"?**


Every option has a price and every price indicates the currency, the amount, if it is binding and the commission.

* *Binding:*

If binding is set as true, then the client can't sell the product, which is provided by the supplier, with an inferior price established by the provider , if it set
as as false, the client can sell the product with an inferior price. 

* *Commission:* 


	-  If commission = 0 then the price returned is a net price, and the
	   provider is informing that the commission **must** be 0.

	-  If commission = -1 then the provider is not informing the sale price 
	   nor if the price is net. This information is obtained when signing with the
	   provider or also if the binding price is true/false.

	-  When commission is greater than 0, for example: commission = 12, it
	   is a sale price, and this commission is informed for the provider 
	   ( this price is mandatory if binding price is true ).

#. **What is a static download and why do we use it?**

    There are times when you want to do a call of your information on-line, 
    but this call can take more that 5 minutes, so, how can we do this quicker?
    We will download all of your information necessary to our servers,
    so when this happens, we can send you the static information
    that we have loaded in our system.



#. **In the tag "RequiredAllPassenger", is specifying the names of the babies necessary?**

    If the value of "RequiredAllPassengers" is true in the static data, then yes,
    it is necessary
