**Response Format**

|

The result returns a list of *DestinationTree* with corresponding
sub-destinations.

Detailled description
---------------------

**Location type:**

::

    <DestinationTree code = "ES" name = "Spain" avail = "false">
        <DestinationLeaf code = "BAL"/>
    </DestinationTree>
    <DestinationTree code = "BAL" name = "Balearic" avail = "true">
        <DestinationLeaf code = "PMI"/>
        <DestinationLeaf code = "ALC"/>
        <DestinationLeaf code = "CON"/>
    </DestinationTree>
    <DestinationTree code = "PMI" name = "Palma" avail = "true"/>
    <DestinationTree code = "ALC" name = "Alcudia" avail = "true"/>
    <DestinationTree code = "CON" name = "Consell" avail = "true"/>

|

This example starts with "<DestinationTree code = "ES" name = "Spain" avail = "false">" where it is indicating that Spain hasn't
got availability because it is false. It also has one child node called <DestinationLeaf code = "BAL"/>. 

This child "BAL" has avail = true, meaning it is possible to do an availability. This node "BAL" also has three other 
children called PMI, ALC, CON. Ergo, If DestinationTree code as avail = "true" and also, at the same time, has one or more
children then this will indicate that this node is a Zone. In this case, if you want to do an avail with this code you will
need to indicate it as a zone type(ZON). 

These three children PMI, ALC, CON also are available because they are true, but the have no DestinationLeaf (or children). 
This indicates that these nodes are cities. In this case, if you want to do an avail with these codes you will need to indicate
them as city types (CTY)  

In conclusion, if the DestinationTree code has avail true and children, means it is a **ZONE**. If the DestinationTree code has
avail true, but no children this will indicate a **CITY**.
